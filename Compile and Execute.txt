# Compile and Execute
---------------------

* Code → Save → Compile → Execute
---------------------------------
	C++ is a compiled language. That means that to get a C++ program to run, you must first translate it from a human-readable form to something a machine can “understand.” That 
	translation is done by a program called a compiler.

	When you program in C++, you mainly go through 4 phases during development:

		1. Code — writing the program

		2. Save — saving the program

		3. Compile — compiling via the terminal

		4. Execute — executing via the terminal

	And repeat (debug the errors if needed).

	Note: Up until now, we’ve been doing the magic for you; Step 2, 3, and 4 were all done by simply pressing the Run button.

				----------> code (debug) ----------> Save ----------> $ g++ hello.cpp
				|						      $ ./a.out
				|							  |	
				|							  |	
				|                                                         |

* Compile and Execute
---------------------
	Compile: A computer can only understand machine code. A compiler can translate the C++ programs that we write into machine code. You call on the compiler by using the terminal, 
	which is the black panel to the right of the code editor that contains a dollar sign $. To compile a file, you need to type g++ followed by the file name in the terminal and press 
	enter:

		g++ hello.cpp

	The compiler will then translate the C++ program hello.cpp and create a machine code file called a.out.

	Execute: To execute the new machine code file, all you need to do is type ./ and the machine code file name in the terminal and press enter. In this case, our compiled file name 
	is a.out. Putting it all together, we end up with the following::

		./a.out

	The executable file will then be loaded to computer memory and the computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the program one instruction at a time.

hello.cpp
---------
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
  
  std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
  
}

==================================================================================================================================================================

* Compile and Execute (Naming Executables)
------------------------------------------
	Compile: Sometimes when we compile, we want to give the output executable file a specific name. To do so, the compile command is slightly different. We still need to write g++ and 
	the file name in the terminal. After that, there should be -o and then the name that you want to give to the executable file:

		g++ hello.cpp -o hello

	The compiler will then translate the C++ program hello.cpp and create a machine code file called hello.

	Execute: To execute the new machine code file, all you need to do is type ./ and the machine code file name in the terminal:

		./hello

	The executable file will then be loaded to computer memory and the computer’s CPU will execute the program one instruction at a time.

hello.cpp
---------
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
  
  std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
  
}

* Comments
----------
	Programming is often highly collaborative. In addition, our own code can quickly become difficult to understand when we return to it — sometimes only a few hours later! For these 
	reasons, it’s often useful to leave notes in our code for ourselves or other developers.

	As we write a C++ program, we can write comments in the code that the compiler will ignore as our program runs. These comments exist just for human readers.

	Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code, or add any other useful annotations.

	There are two types of code comments in C++:

		. A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding it:

			// Prints "hi!" to the terminal
			std::cout << "hi!";

		You can also use a single line comment after a line of code:

			std::cout << "hi!";  // Prints "hi!"

		. A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment:

			/* This is all commented.
			std::cout << "hi!";
			None of this is going to run! */

spell.cpp
---------
// Harry Potter
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
  
  std::cout << "Expecto Patronum\n";
  
}

* Review
--------
	Congratulations! 🙌

	In this lesson, you have learned:

		. Compilation and execution using the terminal.

			g++ hello.cpp -o hello
			./hello

		. Single line comments can be created using //.

		. Multi-line comments can be created using /* */.
